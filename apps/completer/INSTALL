You will need to compile completer.cpp into casm-complete and place the executable somewhere in your path.
The casm completer will use the libcasm.so to print suggestions that get passed to bash.
In order to have the completion actually work, you will also need to source the "casm" completion file.
A typical place to put this is /etc/bash_completion.d but you may just `source casm` at any point.
Lastly, the bash completer script makes use of functions in the "bash-completion" package,
so be sure to install that via brew or apt-get.

example compilation command:
g++ -o casm-complete -I../../include -L/home/jgg/.local/lib -std=c++11 complete.cpp -lcasm -lboost_program_options -lboost_system -lboost_regex
